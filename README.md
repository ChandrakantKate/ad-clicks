# ad-clicks
A leading affiliate network company from Europe wants to leverage machine learning to improve
(optimise) their conversion rates and eventually their topline. Their network is spread across
multiple countries in europe such as Portugal, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland etc.
Affiliate network is a form of online marketing channel where an intermediary promotes products
/ services and earns commission based on conversions (click or sign up). The benefit
companies sees in using such affiliate channels is that, they are able to reach to audience which
doesnâ€™t exist in their marketing reach.
The company wants to improve their CPC (cost per click) performance. A future insight about an
ad performance will give them enough headstart to make changes (if necessary) in their
upcoming CPC campaigns.

I have tried to get insights into the data and predict if the ad will be clicked by the user based on the features.
